Once you're ready to share with the world, you can publish your extension to the community via GitHub - instructions can be found below.

### Installation Prerequisites  
:heavy_check_mark: Install [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/download/)  
:heavy_check_mark: Install [Omniverse Code](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-omniverse-platform/code-app)  
:heavy_check_mark: Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  

### Building Your First Extension  
Once the steps above are complete, getting started is easy. Simply launch Omniverse Code from the NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher, then navigate to the Extensions tab.

Visual Studio Code should automatically open with your newly created project, and you're ready to begin developing your first extension! Navigate to `exts\[your.project.namespace]\your\project\namespace\extension.py` to review the placeholder code and observe the extension window that is now open in Omniverse Code.

## Publishing Your Extension to the Extension Manager
Below is a high level checklist of what you'll need to do in order for your extension to be easily accessible to the Omniverse community.

### Prepare    
:heavy_check_mark: Developer & test your extension  
:heavy_check_mark: Update your `extension.toml` config file found in `exts\[project]\config`  
:heavy_check_mark: Update your extension's `README.md` & `CHANGELOG.md` found in `exts\[project]\docs`  
:heavy_check_mark: Update your extension's icon.png & preview.png images found in `exts\[project]\data`  
### Publish  
:heavy_check_mark: Publish your project to a public repo on GitHub. Ensure your repo's `root` directory contains the `exts\` folder (see our [template](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-extension-template) as an example)  
:heavy_check_mark: Add the `omniverse-kit-extension` [Topic](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) to your repo so that it shows up [here](https://github.com/topics/omniverse-kit-extension)  
:heavy_check_mark: Publish a [Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) for your project    

### Troubleshooting  
* Please allow up to 2 days for your extension to be discoverable in the Extension Manager's Community section.
* Ensure your extension follows the folder structure mentioned above, and be sure to follow namespacing standards: `companyname.category.appname`
* Download and unzip your release's `source.zip` file to ensure the the root directory contains the `exts\` folder

## *NEW* Publishing Your Extension on the Omniverse Exchange
Looking to broaden your reach even more? We are now taking sign-ups for the community to publish directly to the Omniversee Exchange! See the [Omniverse Exchange Publishing Early Access Program](https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse-exchange-publishing-portal) for more details.
